{"name":"Oldland-cpu","tagline":"Oldland CPU - a 32-bit RISC FPGA CPU including RTL + tools","body":"Oldland CPU\r\n===========\r\n\r\nOldland is a 32-bit RISC CPU designed primarily to learn more about Verilog\r\nand FPGA's.  At the moment this consists of the CPU core itself (Oldland), and\r\na SoC implementation (Keynsham) that includes the CPU core, on-chip bootrom,\r\ninternal SRAM, an SDRAM controller and UART.\r\n\r\nIncluded is an instruction set simulator, tools for debugging in gtkwave, a\r\nbootloader (and associated bootrom code).  Documentation is currently sparse\r\nand there are a few working limitations:\r\n\r\n- Only the on-chip memory is connected to the instruction bus.\r\n- The debug interface is incomplete and not connected to any kind of JTAG for\r\nthe FPGA implementation.\r\n- There is no hardware multiply implemented yet.\r\n\r\nThe FPGA target is for a DE0 nano and runs at 50MHz, though it should\r\nsynthesize at >80MHz at the moment.\r\n\r\nLicensing\r\n---------\r\n\r\nThis project is currently licensed under GPLv2.\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
