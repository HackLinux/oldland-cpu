Oldland CPU
===========
Jamie Iles <jamie@jamieiles.com>

Oldland is a 32-bit RISC CPU designed primarily to learn more about Verilog
and FPGA's.  At the moment this consists of the CPU core itself (Oldland), and
a SoC implementation (Keynsham) that includes the CPU core, on-chip bootrom,
internal SRAM, an SDRAM controller and UART.

Included is an instruction set simulator, tools for debugging in gtkwave, a
bootloader (and associated bootrom code).  Documentation is currently sparse
and there are a few working limitations:

- Only the on-chip memory is connected to the instruction bus.
- The debug interface is incomplete and not connected to any kind of JTAG for
the FPGA implementation.
- There is no hardware multiply implemented yet.

The FPGA target is for a DE0 nano and runs at 50MHz, though it should
synthesize at >80MHz at the moment.
